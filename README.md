# Static Photographer Portfolio Website
Welcome to the Static Photographer Portfolio Website, a simple website designed to showcase a photographer's portfolio. This project consists of three HTML files and one CSS file,
providing a structured and visually appealing platform to display photography work, share information about services, and offer a contact form for potential clients.

## Project Overview
The Static Photographer Portfolio Website is crafted to provide photographers with a professional online presence. It includes:

* Home Page: Introduces the photographer and highlights recent projects.
* About Page: Details the photographer's background, services offered, and pricing.
* Portfolio Page: Displays a curated gallery of landscape and portrait photography.
* Contact Section: Allows visitors to get in touch regarding projects or inquiries.
  
## Installation
To view the website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1- Clone the Repository :

‘‘‘git clone https://github.com/KhalilZouhir/Static_photographer_portfolio_Website.git

### Explanation:
- **Start** the code block with three backticks \(```\).
- After the first three backticks, write `html` to indicate that the code block is HTML (or `python`, `css`, etc., for other languages).
